Mr Sucess has a hit maker selling label called: The Knights say Nim Records(KSNR).

Since 1959 his label KSNR has being an absolute sucess, is so much sucess that, he decided give a bonus to the top selling albums, however he is confused(maybe because too much sucess?), he dont know if he does that for top 2, top 3, top 4, top 5, top 100, top 200, top 123, top 3.4 you will need to do something very smart or be ready to code this billions of times :-)

Looks like Mr sucess change his mid very very very often. There is one important thing, Mr sucess dont want see all data for all top selling records, he just dont want to see the whole list! He is looking for a solutiom, needs to be written in Nim, in order to figure out what records are selling more, here are some records and they ids:

```

2 - Master of Puppets | 10 - Sergio Malandro
3 - Appetite For Destruction | 11 - South of Heaven

5 - Cowboys from Hell | 13 - Let's Bora Vol 2.
6 - Let it Bleed | 14 - Tornado Muito Nervoso 2
7 - Xuxa 5 | 15 - Twister, Vol 1
8 - 1(Remastered) | ...
```

he keeps track of the sellings in a napping, a very big one, where every salle has the id.
