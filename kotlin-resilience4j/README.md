# Resilience4j POC

Testing resilience4j library features.

## Requirements
- Java 8
- Maven 3

## Circuit breaker

There are two apps running, the product app and shop app.
The shop app is requesting a service from product app.

### Testing Circuit Breaker

The test scenario is:
- starting two apps.
- stopping product app.
- starting product app again.

I've created a custom header called `isCached` that contain value `true` when the product app is down or `false` when the product app is up.

#### Run command
`$ ./test-circuitbreaker.sh`

#### Output sample
```                                                                                                                                             ï‰’ 45s
