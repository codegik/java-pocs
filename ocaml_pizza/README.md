# Choosing Pizza

We're going to deliver the new product to production.
The engineer team is working hard every day too late.
We usually buy pizzas at night, but we always struggling to choose the flavors, because we have different tastes.
One day one guy was tired of having this issue every day. So he decide to develop a software to facilitate our life.

For each pizza flavor, each engineer should give a note representing how much it likes. Ex: give 1 if hate it, give 5 if love it.
After running the program, each one will know what are the other's tastes, so you can choose to share a pizza with someone that has taste similar to yours.

Given the following data, find the whom has similar taste of each engineer.

``` 
Inacio = {Spicy Chicken: 5, Italian: 3, Four Cheese: 5, Banana: 1, Veggi: 1}
Gamba = {Spicy Chicken: 1, Italian: 3, Four Cheese: 5, Banana: 2, Veggi: 5}
John = {Spicy Chicken: 5, Italian: 5, Four Cheese: 5, Banana: 5, Veggi: 3}
Mary = {Spicy Chicken: 1, Italian: 5, Four Cheese: 5, Banana: 3, Veggi: 2}
