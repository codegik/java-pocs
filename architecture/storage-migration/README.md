# Storage Migration

Food and Co is a US based food chain, that has aliments all over the
place from fruits, vegetables, beans, meat, fish, you name it, food-co
got it. Food-Co is using AWS S3 right now, but the cost is too high.

We need to migrate outside S3, your goal is to create a new
architecture and also plan the migration in order to be smooth and
very chilled migration.

Food-Co uses S3 for a variety of use cases, analytics, image store,
source of truth for images, image segregation and thumbnails,
machine learning, also for storage of food metadata in a JSON files.
